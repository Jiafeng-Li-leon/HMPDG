### A schematic illustration of the HMPDG framework.
### 1) Firstly, integrated features from embedding and topological parameters of the network, RNA expression data, and gene pathogenicity score to construct a random forest classifier(HMPDG) 
### 2) Applying HMPDG, the potential SCZ risk genes were predicted 2 Secondly, we verified the validity of our predicted genes in multiplegenetic studies of schizophrenia.
### 3) Then, we explored the application of the HMPDG to identify causal genes and nominate novel risk genes.
### 4) Finally, we performed systematic analyses to explore the genetic basis and pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
